# Winter is Coming

This extension for Visual Studio Code adds themes titled "Winter is Coming". There are dark, dark with no italics, and light themes.

> I personally use the dark themes for most occasions, but find the light theme good on some dimmer projectors when I present.

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes.

I am using a paid font titled **Dank Mono**. **Operator Mono** is also a paid font that is awesome. If you do not have these fonts, use your favorite font. **Fira Code** is a free one that works well too.
