### <a name="submit-issue" > </a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non- minified stack trace helps
  - **Version ** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
    - **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
      - **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers?
- **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example [Runnable][runnable]) or a unambiguous set of steps
  - **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
- **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

You can file new issues by providing the above information [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-winteriscoming/issues/new).
